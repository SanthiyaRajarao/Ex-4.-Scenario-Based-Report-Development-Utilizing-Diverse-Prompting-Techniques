# Ex-4.-Scenario-Based-Report-Development-Utilizing-Diverse-Prompting-Techniques
Objective: The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation.
## Aim: 
The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation.
## Algorithm: 

#### **Step 1: Define Objectives and Scope**
- Identify key customer service tasks (e.g., order tracking, returns, FAQs).
- Choose platforms (web, mobile, in-store kiosk).
- Set success metrics (response time, resolution rate, customer satisfaction).

#### **Step 2: Collect and Annotate Data**
- Gather real customer queries from retail logs or simulate them.
- Annotate intents (e.g., “Track Order”, “Cancel Item”) and entities (e.g., order ID).
- Use few-shot prompts to bootstrap intent classification.

#### **Step 3: Design and Train the Chatbot**
- Use role-based and chain-of-thought prompts to guide model behavior.
- Implement fallback strategies for ambiguous queries.
- Train on annotated data using NLP models (e.g., BERT, GPT-based).

#### **Step 4: Test and Evaluate**
- Run test cases using scripted and live queries.
- Use self-reflection prompts to assess response quality.
- Measure against KPIs: accuracy, empathy, escalation rate.

#### **Step 5: Analyze Results and Report**
- Summarize findings with charts, confusion matrices, and user feedback.
- Use instruction-based prompts to generate executive summaries.
- Recommend improvements and next steps (e.g., multilingual support, personalization).
